/**
 * This string stream provides the lexer with upper case characters only. This greatly simplifies
 * lexing the stream, while we can maintain the original command.
 * <p>
 * This is based on Hive's org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.parse.ParseDriver.ANTLRNoCaseStringStream
 * <p>
 * The comment below (taken from the original class) describes the rationale for doing this:
 * <p>
 * This class provides and implementation for a case insensitive token checker for the lexical
 * analysis part of antlr. By converting the token stream into upper case at the time when lexical
 * rules are checked, this class ensures that the lexical rules need to just match the token with
 * upper case letters as opposed to combination of upper case and lower case characters. This is
 * purely used for matching lexical rules. The actual token text is stored in the same way as the
 * user input without actually converting it into an upper case. The token values are generated by
 * the consume() function of the super class ANTLRStringStream. The LA() function is the lookahead
 * function and is purely used for matching lexical rules. This also means that the grammar will
 * only accept capitalized tokens in case it is run from other tools like antlrworks which do not
 * have the ANTLRNoCaseStringStream implementation.
