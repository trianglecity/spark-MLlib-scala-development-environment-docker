  /**
   * Generates the logical plan for generating window ranges on a timestamp column. Without
   * knowing what the timestamp value is, it's non-trivial to figure out deterministically how many
   * window ranges a timestamp will map to given all possible combinations of a window duration,
   * slide duration and start time (offset). Therefore, we express and over-estimate the number of
   * windows there may be, and filter the valid windows. We use last Project operator to group
   * the window columns into a struct so they can be accessed as <code>window.start</code> and <code>window.end</code>.
   * <p>
   * The windows are calculated as below:
   * maxNumOverlapping <- ceil(windowDuration / slideDuration)
   * for (i <- 0 until maxNumOverlapping)
   *   windowId <- ceil((timestamp - startTime) / slideDuration)
   *   windowStart <- windowId * slideDuration + (i - maxNumOverlapping) * slideDuration + startTime
   *   windowEnd <- windowStart + windowDuration
   *   return windowStart, windowEnd
   * <p>
   * This behaves as follows for the given parameters for the time: 12:05. The valid windows are
   * marked with a +, and invalid ones are marked with a x. The invalid ones are filtered using the
   * Filter operator.
   * window: 12m, slide: 5m, start: 0m :: window: 12m, slide: 5m, start: 2m
   *     11:55 - 12:07 +                      11:52 - 12:04 x
   *     12:00 - 12:12 +                      11:57 - 12:09 +
   *     12:05 - 12:17 +                      12:02 - 12:14 +
   * <p>
   * @param plan The logical plan
   * @return the logical plan that will generate the time windows using the Expand operator, with
   *         the Filter operator for correctness and Project for usability.
