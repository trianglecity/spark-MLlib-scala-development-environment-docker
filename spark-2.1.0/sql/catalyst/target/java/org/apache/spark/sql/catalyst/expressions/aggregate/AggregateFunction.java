/**
 * AggregateFunction is the superclass of two aggregation function interfaces:
 * <p>
 *  - {@link ImperativeAggregate} is for aggregation functions that are specified in terms of
 *    initialize(), update(), and merge() functions that operate on Row-based aggregation buffers.
 *  - {@link DeclarativeAggregate} is for aggregation functions that are specified using
 *    Catalyst expressions.
 * <p>
 * In both interfaces, aggregates must define the schema ({@link aggBufferSchema}) and attributes
 * ({@link aggBufferAttributes}) of an aggregation buffer which is used to hold partial aggregate
 * results. At runtime, multiple aggregate functions are evaluated by the same operator using a
 * combined aggregation buffer which concatenates the aggregation buffers of the individual
 * aggregate functions.
 * <p>
 * Code which accepts {@link AggregateFunction} instances should be prepared to handle both types of
 * aggregate functions.
