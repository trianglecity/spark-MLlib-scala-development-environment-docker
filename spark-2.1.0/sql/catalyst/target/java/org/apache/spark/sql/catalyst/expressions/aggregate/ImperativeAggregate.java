/**
 * API for aggregation functions that are expressed in terms of imperative initialize(), update(),
 * and merge() functions which operate on Row-based aggregation buffers.
 * <p>
 * Within these functions, code should access fields of the mutable aggregation buffer by adding the
 * bufferSchema-relative field number to <code>mutableAggBufferOffset</code> then using this new field number
 * to access the buffer Row. This is necessary because this aggregation function's buffer is
 * embedded inside of a larger shared aggregation buffer when an aggregation operator evaluates
 * multiple aggregate functions at the same time.
 * <p>
 * We need to perform similar field number arithmetic when merging multiple intermediate
 * aggregate buffers together in <code>merge()</code> (in this case, use <code>inputAggBufferOffset</code> when accessing
 * the input buffer).
 * <p>
 * Correct ImperativeAggregate evaluation depends on the correctness of <code>mutableAggBufferOffset</code> and
 * <code>inputAggBufferOffset</code>, but not on the correctness of the attribute ids in <code>aggBufferAttributes</code>
 * and <code>inputAggBufferAttributes</code>.
