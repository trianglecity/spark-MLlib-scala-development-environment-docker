/**
 * A strategy for planning scans over collections of files that might be partitioned or bucketed
 * by user specified columns.
 * <p>
 * At a high level planning occurs in several phases:
 *  - Split filters by when they need to be evaluated.
 *  - Prune the schema of the data requested based on any projections present. Today this pruning
 *    is only done on top level columns, but formats should support pruning of nested columns as
 *    well.
 *  - Construct a reader function by passing filters and the schema into the FileFormat.
 *  - Using a partition pruning predicates, enumerate the list of files that should be read.
 *  - Split the files into tasks and construct a FileScanRDD.
 *  - Add any projection or filters that must be evaluated after the scan.
 * <p>
 * Files are assigned into tasks using the following algorithm:
 *  - If the table is bucketed, group files by bucket id into the correct number of partitions.
 *  - If the table is not bucketed or bucketing is turned off:
 *   - If any file is larger than the threshold, split it into pieces based on that threshold
 *   - Sort the files by decreasing file size.
 *   - Assign the ordered files to buckets using the following algorithm.  If the current partition
 *     is under the threshold with the addition of the next file, add it.  If not, open a new bucket
 *     and add it.  Proceed to the next file.
