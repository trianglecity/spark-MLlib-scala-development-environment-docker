 * up aggregates w/ key.
 * <p>
 * We also have VectorizedHashMapGenerator, which generates a append-only vectorized hash map.
 * We choose one of the two as the 1st level, fast hash map during aggregation.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This row-based hash map currently doesn't support nullable keys and falls back to the
 * <code>BytesToBytesMap</code> to store them.
