/**
 * The UnboundFollowing window frame calculates frames with the following SQL form:
 * ... BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
 * <p>
 * There is only an upper bound. This is a slightly modified version of the sliding window. The
 * sliding window operator has to check if both upper and the lower bound change when a new row
 * gets processed, where as the unbounded following only has to check the lower bound.
 * <p>
 * This is a very expensive operator to use, O(n * (n - 1) /2), because we need to maintain a
 * buffer and must do full recalculation after each row. Reverse iteration would be possible, if
 * the commutativity of the used window functions can be guaranteed.
 * <p>
 * param:  target to write results to.
 * param:  processor to calculate the row values with.
 * param:  lbound comparator used to identify the lower bound of an output row.
