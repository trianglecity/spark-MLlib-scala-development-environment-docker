/**
 * The UnboundPreceding window frame calculates frames with the following SQL form:
 * ... BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
 * <p>
 * There is only an upper bound. Very common use cases are for instance running sums or counts
 * (row_number). Technically this is a special case of a sliding window. However a sliding window
 * has to maintain a buffer, and it must do a full evaluation everytime the buffer changes. This
 * is not the case when there is no lower bound, given the additive nature of most aggregates
 * streaming updates and partial evaluation suffice and no buffering is needed.
 * <p>
 * param:  target to write results to.
 * param:  processor to calculate the row values with.
 * param:  ubound comparator used to identify the upper bound of an output row.
